  The multi-demensional array below contains packages with prices but
  they are all out of order and I want to present them to my customer
  in the correct order with the lowest price first
 -->

<?php
  $packagesArray = array(
    array('name' => 'Package 1', 'price' => 5.99),
    array('name' => 'Package 2', 'price' => 3.01),
    array('name' => 'Package 3', 'price' => 100.01),
    array('name' => 'Package 4', 'price' => 11.00),
    array('name' => 'Package 5', 'price' => 25.95),
    array('name' => 'Package 6', 'price' => 10.99),
    array('name' => 'Package 7', 'price' => 11.00),
  );
?>

          this for each loop will iterate over each item above and
          set $package as the inner array so we can have access to it directly
          this is appose to accessing them like so $packagesArray[0]['name'];
         -->

        <?php endforeach ?>
